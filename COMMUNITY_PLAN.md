-	Added value through European network
-	National language teams
-	Security and relief for Main-Nodes
-	Promotion by TRON Convention

The TRON-Europe team of experts creates an environment in every EU country for a decentralized, efficient network structure. This means that at least 3 sites in each country have  an extremely stable and secure network. This ensures high availability and accessibility. Every year, we will open up 10-12 new locations in EU countries. The goal is to connect these new locations all over Europe within 3 years. Teams of local experts, which we choose before,  will be assembled to ensure national language communication. These teams will be responsible for securing and operating the local servers with special applications or something which improves the tron network.

Through this European network we create added value together with the community. The versatility of TRON will increase enormously. TRON will be integrated into everyday life in the near future. Another goal is to be able to withdraw cash from vending machines or to pay on the open market.

By deploying this Europe-wide network, TRON-Europe relieves the main servers and can act as a backup for the main nodes if needed.
Our advantage is that we provide our own, not cloud-based servers, which are flexible and scalable. These servers are independent of third parties, which promises high security and functionality. By using virtual server environments, we can use any operating system, which allows us to adapt to all needs individually.

Hardware Specifications:
- 64 CPU cores
- 2 TB Ram
- 20 TB SSD
- 2 x 10 GB Network

With the installation of a new server, a TRON Convention will take place, where the team from the respective country can announce theirself. These teams are very important for the network, the economics and the growth of TRON. After reaching our target to connect all European countries, we gained 28x5 teams. These 140 teams are only and exclusive working for TRON.
